# RESTFUL API by using Spring boot and Heroku
## 1) Starting with Spring boot
From https://start.spring.io, as a Maven project, Spring boot 2.4.4,Java version 8.
I added 3 dependencies(Web,JPA and H2) to Spring boot and downloaded JAR file.
## 2) Opening JAR in Eclipse
I imported JAR file as Existing Maven Project and created new project.
## 3) Designing RESTFUL API
I started create my object USER firstly.Initialized private ID and public name .Then overrided equals,hash,toString methods.
Then wrote UserController where we use CRUD operations.
